  <center>  <h1>Challenge 5</h1>
    <h2>
        a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. 
            </h2>  </center>
<h2>
This is how to work out whether if a particular year is a leap year:
<ol>
    <li>A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4 ;</li>

    <li>except if that year is also evenly divisible by 100;</li>

    <li>unless that year is also evenly divisible by 400.</li>
    </ol></h2>
    
    <center>
    <h2>

e.g. Is the year 2000 a leap year?:

2000 รท 4 = 500 (Leap)

2000 รท 100 = 20 (Not Leap)

2000 รท 400 = 5 (Leap!)
</h2>
        <h3>The results are also logged into the console.</h3>
    </center>
    
    
    <script>
var y = parseInt(prompt("Enter the year you want to evaluate:")); 
        
function isLeap(year) {
    
  if ((year%4===0)&&(year%100!==0)) {
      return "Leap year.";
  } else if ((year%4===0)&&(year%400===0)){
      return "Leap year.";
  }else{
      return "Not leap year.";
  }

    


}
        
alert(isLeap(y));
console.log(isLeap(y));        
        
        
    </script>
