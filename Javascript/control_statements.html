    // Switch statements:-                                                                  The JavaScript switch statement evaluates an expression and executes a block of code based on matching cases. It provides an alternative to long if-else chains, improving readability and maintainability, especially when handling multiple conditional branches. 
        
    // When using switch statments another keywords becomes particularly important:-
        
        //Break Statement: After executing a code block, the break statement terminates the switch statement, preventing execution from falling through to subsequent cases. If break is omitted, execution will continue to the next case (known as “fall-through”).
        
//Default Case: The default case is optional. If no match is found, the code block under default is executed.
