  <center>  <h1>Challenge 3</h1>
    <h2>I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.<br><br>

In this challenge, a function is created that tells us  how much time one has left to live assuming one reaches 90 years of age
<br><br>

It will take user's current age as the input and console.logs a message with  time left in this format:<br><br>
<br>
        <b>You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.</b><br><br><br>

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

</h2>
      
<h4>The results are console logged.</h4>

     var enter = parseInt(prompt("Enter Your age:"));//input (age) taken from the user
          
function lifeInWeeks(age) {//declaring the function
    var k = 90 - age;      //operation on input 
    
 return ("You have "+(k*365)+" days, "+(k*52)+" weeks, and "+(k*12)+" months left.");
}
  console.log(lifeInWeeks(enter));
